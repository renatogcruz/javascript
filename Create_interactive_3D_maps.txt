Create interactive 3D maps with our new JavaScript API - email dia 25/02/2022

Part of the art of designing a positive user experience is giving your application the flexibility to display information in the most intuitive way. That might be a top-down map view with a strict “Up = North” rule. Or, it might be an interactive map showing buildings and features – so users can find landmarks and neighborhoods.

3D Maps and JavaScript

If a more interactive, flexible view is just what your app needs, we have some good news. The latest version of the HERE JavaScript API allows you to provide 3D views that give your maps a fresher, more detailed look with a minimum amount of new code.

By the time you’ve completed the hands-on example below, you’ll have created a new map using our new vector tiles and 3D renderer, and set the location, zoom and area of the view you want to provide your users.
